        I hereby declare, under oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all loyalty to the Revolution, its rulers and the system that has been implanted in Cuba, of whom or of which I have been subject or citizen until now; that I will support and defend the laws of all Cubans against the enemies of freedom and the idea of ​​democracy, for which dissidents have been disappeared, arrested, injured, assassinated, buried in mass graves or at the bottom of the Florida Straits; that I will maintain true commitment and loyalty to the cause of the overthrow of the dictatorship that governs Cuba; that I will bear the arms of the pain of those who have been forced to emigrate and I will fight alongside them; that I will be willing to offer my service when the Cubans who suffer and demonstrate for freedom require it; that I will not carry out this work under the direction of some power external to my interests or based on any gain other than freedom; and that I assume this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion. Long Live Free Cuba!
